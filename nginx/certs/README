This directory should contain private key and certificates. Because OCSP stapling is enabled in the config, an ordinary self-signed key/certificate pair is not enough (or wasn't enough in July 2022), but an own CA with no support for OCSP will be ok (a warning will be logged).
An example script for creating CA is in scripts/CA. A modification to scripts/CA/cnf/server.conf is suggested, because the default domains probably won't work by default.

This directory is gitignored to avoid committing private keys.

Expected files:
- privkey.pem (private key)
- fullchain.pem (full certificate chain with the leaf certificate)
- chain.pem (CA and intermediate certificates)
